Arduino Library for
ClosedCube TMP116 ±0.2°C (max) High-Accuracy Low-Power I2C Temperature Sensor breakout board
===

This is breakout board for [Texas Instruments TMP116](http://www.ti.com/product/TMP116) High-Accuracy Low-Power Digital Temperature Sensor

TMP116 operating temperature range of –55°C to +125°C and exceeds A RTD class accuracy and consumes less that a typical PT100 RTD as well as eliminating requiremens for calibration, external circuitry, matched traces and Kelvin connections.

**Features:**
 - Accuracy Without Calibration:
   -  ±0.2°C (max) From –10°C to +85°C
   -  ±0.25°C (max) From –40°C to +105°C
   -  ±0.3°C (max) From +105°C to +125°C
 - 16 Bits Resolution at 0.0078°C (1 LSB)
 - Low Quiescent Current 3.5-µA (1-Hz Conversion Cycle) and 250-nA Shutdown Current
 - Wide supply voltage range from 1.9 V to 5.5 V
 - Programmable Temperature Alert Limits
 - 64 Bits General-Purpose EEPROM 
 - NIST Traceability

**Note:** The library depends on: [ClosedCube I2C Driver for Arduino](https://github.com/closedcube/ClosedCube_I2C_Arduino)
